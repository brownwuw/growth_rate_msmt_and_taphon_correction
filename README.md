Brown, William A. 2014. Through a filter, darkly: population size estimation, systematic error, and random error in radiocarbon-supported demographic temporal frequency analysis, _Journal of Archaeological Science_ Available online 23 October 2014, ISSN 0305-4403, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.10.013. (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440314003835)

The paper addresses best practices in extracting demographic information from archaeological and paleontological temporal frequency distributions. In particular, a proportional growth rate, the 'equivalent growth rate,' is recommended, identical in calculation to the calculation of r-bar in formal demography. This measure is surprisingly resilient against multiple ocnfounding sources of error, and the illustrations coded here are offered in an article in support of this claim.
